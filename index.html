Hey, my name is Ania Warzecha. I'm a software engineer with 15+ years of hands-on experience. I am based in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.<br/><br/>

I maintain minimal investment in my professional online presence. You can find the most up to date information about my work on <a href="https://pl.linkedin.com/in/annawarzecha" target="_blank">my Linkedin</a>.<br/><br/>

I will rarely post something on <a href="/blog/">my blog</a>.<br/><br/>

<!-- I get asked for growth related books, so I gathered them under <a href="/books/">books</a>.<br/><br/>-->

I also try to keep a semi-updated page about where I am at with my life <a href="/now/">now</a>.<br/><br/>
