When using transaction.atomic() we should remember that it can commit or rollback just the db related calls inside the atomic() block. It's not able to rewind a HTTP call, a call to redis or putting a payload on any queueing system. This means in case of a rollback we'd emit an event or call an external API to inform it about an object which effectively was not saved to the database.

In the project Iâ€™m working on now a real life scenario would e.g. end up sending an e-mail or an SMS to a person when their order was not created and customer support would need to deal with this.

A good practice is tho have the atomic() block the minimal set of db calls which have to be run together. Everything else should ideally be moved out.
